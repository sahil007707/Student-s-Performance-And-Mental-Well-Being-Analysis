# 🧠 Student Habits, Mental Health & Performance Analysis

This project explores the impact of students' habits and mental health on their academic performance using data visualization and analysis techniques in Python.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Understand correlations between study habits, lifestyle, mental health, and academic results.
- **Dataset**: A student performance dataset from Kaggle with factors like sleep patterns, study hours, social habits, and stress levels.
- **Techniques Used**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation heatmaps, and interactive visualizations using Plotly.

## 📚 Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `plotly.express` for interactive visualizations

## 📁 Files

- `student_habits_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Ensure the dataset path is correct (you may need to adjust it).
4. Run the notebook cells in order.

## 📌 Notes
- This analysis is useful for educators, counselors, or data enthusiasts interested in mental health and academic analytics.

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Integrate predictive modeling (e.g., linear regression or classification).
- Add dashboard visualization using Streamlit or Dash.
